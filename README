== Installation ==
Download from here:
http://github.com/SeanHayes/firefox-color-management-add-on/downloads
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6891

Either your browser will prompt you to install the add-on, or it will get downloaded to your computer. If it gets downloaded or if you're using an .xpi file from the builds/ directory:

1. Open Firefox (or what ever XUL app you're using)
2. Go to File -> Open File
3. Select the .xpi file that was downloaded and open it.
4. Firefox should now install the add-on.

== Source Code ==
The source code is located in the dev/ directory.

== Building the .xpi ==
The building process can be automated by using the Extension Developer add-on
for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7434.

The resulting file should be named in the following format and placed in the builds/ directory:
color_management_<version>.xpi
