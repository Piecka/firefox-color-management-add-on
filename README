== Installation ==
Download from here:
http://github.com/SeanHayes/firefox-color-management-add-on/downloads
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6891

Either your browser will prompt you to install the add-on, or it will get downloaded to your computer. If it gets downloaded or if you're using an .xpi file from the builds/ directory:

1. Open Firefox (or what ever XUL app you're using)
2. Go to File -> Open File
3. Select the .xpi file that was downloaded and open it.
4. Firefox should now install the add-on.

== Live Testing the Development Code ==
Building an .xpi and installing it isn't necessary to test add-on development code within Firefox. To try out the development code:
1. Open your Firefox profile directory
2. Enter the extensions directory
3. Create a file named "color_management@seanhayes.name".
4. Inside this file, type the path to the directory of the development code (e.g. /home/user/firefox-color-management-add-on/dev/) and save.

The next time you open Firefox with that profile, the development version of the add-on will be installed.

== Source Code ==
The source code is located in the dev/ directory.

== Building the .xpi ==
The building process can be automated by using the Extension Developer add-on
for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7434.

The resulting file should be named in the following format and placed in the builds/ directory:
color_management_<version>.xpi
